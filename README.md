# YouTube-Comment-Analysis
YouTube is a public service. Viewers typically come from different backgrounds with a broad spectrum of opinions. Therefore, the assumption that all comments carry useful information is unrealistic. While some users may post comments that are beneficial to both the content creators and viewers, others may post comments that are entirely irrelevant or do not contain any useful information. Therefore, the first objective of our analysis is to determine how informative are the comments on YouTube coding videos. Filtering massive amounts of comments manually can be a tedious and error-prone task.Therefore, for any solution to be practical, an automated approach is needed to effectively filter through data and separate informative from uninformative comments with a decent level of accuracy. YouTube comments can be lexically (e.g., abbreviations and colloquial terminology) and semantically (i.e., lack of proper grammars) restricted. Furthermore, several comments might raise similar concerns. Presenting such large, and maybe redundant, amounts of raw comments to the content creator can cause confusion. This emphasizes the need for automated methods to summarize informative comments to enable a more effective data exploration process.
